**Problem Statement**

How to securely implement email sending functionality in a Next.js application using Nodemailer, leveraging a Google App Password for authentication.

**Tech Stack**

1. NextJS14

**Implementation Details**

This project will leverage Next.js 14 for a unified development experience, encompassing both frontend and backend functionalities. We'll initiate by constructing the user interface, followed by the implementation of API endpoints using Next.js API Routes. This approach eliminates the need for separate backend technologies, streamlining development and deployment.
Once the API layer is established, we'll configure a Gmail account with two-factor authentication (2FA) and generate an App Password. These credentials will be securely stored as environment variables to facilitate email sending via the Nodemailer library. Successful form submissions will trigger email delivery using a pre-designed template to the specified Gmail address.
